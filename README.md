## CRUD Operations

The logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations is controlled by the CRUD APIs. These APIs enable users to post Interesting Announcements, like them, and comment on them, fostering a dynamic and engaging environment. CRUD APIs available in the [m]TR3lea BackEnd repository.
